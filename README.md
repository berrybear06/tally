# Tally

Tally is my online collection of minigames that teach math and other core topics to students with special needs.
With its accuracy tracker, adaptive answer choices, and varied set of potential questions, 
it simplifies and standardizes the task of assessing students' learning.
Although it's still in development, Tally has already produced real benefits in real classrooms.
